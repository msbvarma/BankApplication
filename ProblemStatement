Problem Statement:

Any user should be able to register to this service
All registered users can get the list of banks that are supported by this service
User can pick one of the bank and find the metadata about that bank, metadata includes
What are the credentials needed to get access the bank website example username/password
User can provide the necessary credentials and collect all the bank accounts available in the bank & also its associated transactions
              Example: Saving account and its attributes and the credit / debit transactions

 

Notes:

Bank can be mocked using an html based application
Bank data can be hard coded in the html application
Any approach can be used to collect the data from Bank (such as screen scraping or REST API)
Use mysql as backend to store the data, use maven as a build platform, preferably code with Spring or Spring Boot

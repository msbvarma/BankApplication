Based on the problem statement I have built various services to achieve the solution.
Technologies used:
                    Spring boot
                    Java
                    mySQL
                    Maven
    
Assumption 1:
    User data and Account details are stored in Data base.
Assumption 2:
    We need to give the response to the UI /calling source, they will show to end user.
Services:
Any user should be able to register to this service
                URL: http://localhost:8080/bankapp/register - POST service.

All registered users can get the list of banks that are supported by this service
                URL: http://localhost:8080/bankapp/ getBankData - POST service            

User can pick one of the bank and find the metadata about that bank, metadata includes
What are the credentials needed to get access the bank website example username/password
            
                URL: http://localhost:8080/bankapp/getBankMetaData  - POST service 
                Note: Assumption is SSO is enabled in this application to get the data

User can provide the necessary credentials and collect all the bank accounts available in the bank & also its associated transactions
                URL: http://localhost:8080/bankapp/getAccountDetails   - POST service 
                Intern it calls the below Rest service
                http://localhost:8080/bankdata/getAccountData
